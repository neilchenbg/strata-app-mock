    "summary":"Students at Strata University will soon be able to take advantage of a free shuttle service that will operate between the City Center and Lake Campuses, county officials announced on Monday. The service was the brainchild of student John Smith, a City Center resident who found it challenging to reach the Lake Campus. Most of the nursing studentâ€™s classes are in City Center, but he also needs access to the Lake Campus. So she started a petition. After gathering 300 signatures, she presented her petition to the college, and his idea became a reality. The shuttle comes courtesy a partnership between the college and the county. It will run Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., beginning Feb 1st.",
